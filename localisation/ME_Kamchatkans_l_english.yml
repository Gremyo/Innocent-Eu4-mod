 ME_Kamchatkan_Events.1.t: "The Great Migration"
 ME_Kamchatkan_Events.1.d: "We have shown that the Eastern Lands are teeming with with life and of bountiful game. The elder Chiefs of the Federation have gathered to discuss a proposition: to move the seat of the Chiefdom to the East. They argue that the lands here are too dangerous, with too many potential invaders, and that despite leaving behind our homelands, we can carry the memory of them within our oral traditions. Understandably, the reception is mixed; this is a turning point for our nation, after all."
 ME_Kamchatkan_Events.1.a: "A leap of faith."
 ME_Kamchatkan_Events.1.b: "We must preserve our motherland."
